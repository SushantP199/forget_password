To keep your accounts safe T I C K E T concept is used in this app.

T I C K E T must be exact same for all the accounts you store.

After 6 consitent wrong entries for T I C K E T, access to your accounts will be denied for next 6 hours.

If you forget the T I C K E T itself, then there is no way to get it back. And eventually you will lost all you passwords stored forever.

Not to worry ðŸ˜Œ.

You just have to remember one single T I C K E T ðŸ˜‡ of eight characters throughout entire app.

(By the way it is way more easier than remembering different usernames and passwords ðŸ˜– for all the accounts like before)
